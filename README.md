# Digital Transformation Roadmap Tool

---

## Overview

Digital transformation is a crucial process for modern businesses, involving the integration of new digital technologies into all aspects of an organization. Contrary to popular belief, it's not exclusive to digital-native companies or large corporations. Any organization, regardless of size or industry, can benefit from embracing digital transformation to optimize processes and enhance performance. To embark on this journey, companies typically undergo a series of audits: strategic, digital, and cultural.

This project aims to streamline the digital transformation process by developing a web application specifically designed to facilitate the creation of a Digital Transformation Roadmap. The application automates various tasks associated with conducting audits and deriving actionable insights to guide the transformation journey.
